# E06b-Sound-and-Music

This is an exercise for MSCH-G220 Game Technology as an introductory module to applying and using audio nodes within GODOT to add sounds and music to GODOT games.

The following noises are found within this GODOT file:

- A metallic thunk
- The slap of a plastic spoon
- An explosive end to a bag of cheetos

"BeepyBoop" Music made by Aeris Meadows, my dear friend and coding assistant.


Enjoy!
